I am a fifth year PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.uga.edu) at University of Georgia. My current research interests are broadly in additive combinatorics, extremal combinatorics and probabilistic methods. My advisor is [Giorgis Petridis](https://www.math.uga.edu/directory/people/giorgis-petridis). Prior to this, I graduated from the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER) Bhubaneswar in India, with an Integrated MSc degree in Mathematics.
